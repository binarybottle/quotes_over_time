Quotes over Time tracks the top-quoted people from 

<A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('http://www.alertnet.org')">Reuters Alertnet News</a>

on a range of topics, and presents their quotes on a timeline. This demonstration automatically collected pilot data over the last few months of 2006.
Please click on the graphs and quotes to see full stories (requires that <b>popups</b> be turned on in your browser; the site has been optimized for the Firefox browser).

<A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('https://binarybottle.com')">Arno Klein</a> initially developed Quotes over Time as a purely academic endeavor (all sources are cited). 
As it has garnered interest, we felt that it could serve as a generally useful resource, particularly for news organizations, policy analysts, and media analysts.

Behind the scenes:

<br />

<ul>																		
  News stories are collected from 

<A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('http://www.alertnet.org')">Reuters Alertnet</a>

with 

<A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('https://github.com/binarybottle/quotes_over_time')">custom code</a> written in Python.

</ul>
<ul>
  The text is parsed to extract headlines, timestamps, sources, quotes, "coined expressions," names, and such (with more custom Python code)
  and after further processing these are stored in a MySQL database.
</ul>
<ul>
  Pronominal coreferencing (e.g., attributing "she said" to the appropriate individual) is performed with 

<!--A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/')"-->opennlp<!--/a-->. 

a Java suite of programs for natural language processing.
</ul>
<ul>
  The front-end application is written in PHP, style sheets, and some javascript (popups and 

<A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex2/generaltick.htm')">fades</a>).
<br />																								   
The larger graphs are created in 

<!--A HREF="javascript:popUpFull('http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/')"-->JPGraph<!--/a-->, 
based on PHP's GD library, and the smaller graphs are created with a PHP implementation of Tufte's Sparklines.
